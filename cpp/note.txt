Concept of Class and Object:

-- Private data of class is accessable to the class inherited from that
class(inheritance purpose).
-- Friend class can access all the data of class (private,protected and public).

Constructor and Destructor:
-- Constructor is function which is called whent he instanc of class created.
-- Destructor is used to free the memory that is created when the constructor
created.
-- Destructor called automatically when the object goes out of scope.
